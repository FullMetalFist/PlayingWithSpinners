## Synopsis

Wanted to play with Animations, found a pretty sweet tutorial from Ben Dietzkis
https://medium.com/@cocotutch/ui-sugar-spirals-1b515a258944

## Code Example

Drag & drop the file 'Colorizer' into your app.
Create the UIView subclass as a ColorizerView in Storyboard.

To fire the animation:
`colorizerView.startAnimating()`

To stop it:
`colorizerView.stopAnimating()`

## Motivation

Just wanted to tinker with animations, and share the result
